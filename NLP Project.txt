“Tweets” dataset has the tweets from an airline company. Perform the following activities given the above dataset using Python & ML
1. Build a classification model using the airline_sentiment column as the target variable and use the “text” column as the input text for the model
2. Perform the following preprocessing
a. Clean the text
b. Create Document term matrix using the TFIDFVectorizer
c. Add additional variables or features from the dataset to improve the performance
d. Perform lemmatisation or any other form of text cleansing
e. Create a feature that counts the number of punctuation marks per each sentence
f. Create a feature that counts the length of each tweet
3. Compute metrics such as precision recall and classification for all the three classes
4. Build a feed forward neural network that can perform multi class classification
